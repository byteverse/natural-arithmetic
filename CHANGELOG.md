# Revision history for natural-arithmetic

## 0.1.4.0 -- 2023-05-31

* Add unboxed Nat type
* Add nominal role for Fin# type constructor. Technically, this is a breaking
  change, but if anyone was using coerce on a Fin#, they were already in a
  bunch of trouble. So, there is not going to be a major version bump for this.

## 0.1.3.0 -- 2022-05-23

* Add strict variant of descend.
* Add unboxed Fin type

## 0.1.2.0 -- 2019-01-20

## 0.1.1.0 -- 2019-11-22

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-09-04
